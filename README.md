# TOTVS Labs Coding Challenge - Mobile
Our React-native coding challenge is a simple "Crypto Tracker". Users should be able to add a new cryptocurrency, visualize the current price and the change in price in the last 24 hours for the cryptocurrencies they have added, they should also be able to remove a cryptocurrency from the "Crypto Tracker". 

```
Important: Please make sure you use ReactNative and Redux. 
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions 
on how to get the app up and running..
```

# Suggested design
You can find bellow the mockup for a suggested design. Feel free to use it or create your own:

# Main Features of the app

### 1) List of cryptocurrencies
Users should be able to visualize the list of cryptocurrencies they current have on the app

### 2) Current price and percentage change in the last 24h
Users should also be able to visualize: 
Current price for the cryptocurrencies added
Change in percentage in USD in the last 24h

### 3) API to get pricing and percentage change
Feel free to use the pricing and percentage change provider of your preference. One of the simplest ones that doesn't require registration is Messari. You can find a sample bellow:
